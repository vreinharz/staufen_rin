There are two scripts:
    1) draw_single_graph.py: To visualize the graphs
    2) analyze.py to identify the matches between the pos/neg staufen sequences and clusters

The /Data folder only contain clusters_IL.pickle, which needs to be given as argument to the flag "-c" to analyze.py,
it is the set of clusters of graphs with non-canonical interactions for which we try to find a match.

Assuming that the data with sequences is at:
    ../Data/hStau1_SRS_loops/posplus/loops_in_SRS_flanking2nt.txt
we can run 
    python3 analyse.py -c ../Data/clusters_IL.pickle -i ../Data/hStau1_SRS_loops/posplus/loops_in_SRS_flanking2nt.txt

To see all the options do:
    python3 analyze.py -h
